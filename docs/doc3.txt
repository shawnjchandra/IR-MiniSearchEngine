Title: Quantum Computing Breakthrough

Scientists at major tech companies are racing to achieve quantum supremacy. These revolutionary computers use quantum bits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, potentially solving complex problems in cryptography, drug discovery, and climate modeling that would take classical computers millions of years to complete. Recent advances in error correction and qubit stability bring us closer to practical quantum applications.
