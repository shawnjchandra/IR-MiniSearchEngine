Title: The Mage of the Hollow Peaks

Exiled for forbidden magic, a lone mage guards ancient secrets in the Hollow Peaks. When darkness stirs, his knowledge may be the last hope. Decades of solitude have sharpened his understanding of shadow magic, though the cost has been his connection to humanity. Strange creatures emerge from deep caves, responding to an ancient call that only he remembers. The scrolls he protects contain spells that predate the kingdom itself.
