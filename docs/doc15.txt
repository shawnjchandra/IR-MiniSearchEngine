Title: The Elven Rebellion

Bound by duty, a young elf defies the high council to save her kin from an ancient curse. War brews as old pacts unravel. Centuries of tradition crumble as younger elves question the wisdom of their elders. Forest spirits withdraw their blessing as political tensions escalate into open conflict. The curse spreads like wildfire through the sacred groves, threatening to corrupt the very essence of elven magic.
