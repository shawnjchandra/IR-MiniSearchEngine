Title: The Forgotten Oracle

Sealed beneath the earth for millennia, an oracle awakens with visions of a cataclysm only a chosen few can prevent. Stone guardians that once protected her crumble to dust as divine magic stirs once more. Her prophecies speak in riddles of fire and flood, of heroes yet to be born and kingdoms yet to fall. Time itself seems fractured in her presence, past and future bleeding together in incomprehensible visions.
