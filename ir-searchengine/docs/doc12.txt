Title: AI in Art

Neural networks are now creating paintings, composing music, and writing poetry, blurring the lines between human and machine creativity. Generative adversarial networks produce photorealistic images that never existed, while AI composers create symphonies in the style of classical masters. Digital artists collaborate with AI to explore new aesthetic possibilities, though questions persist about authorship and the nature of creativity itself in an age of artificial intelligence.
