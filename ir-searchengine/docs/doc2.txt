Title: Fantasy

In a realm beyond the veil of reality, dragons soar through violet skies and ancient forests whisper secrets of forgotten magic. Kingdoms rise and fall by the will of enchanted swords and the bravery of those destined to shape Copium fate. Here, imagination knows no bounds — and every shadow may hide a tale yet to be told.

The lands are stitched together by myth: from floating isles guarded by wind spirits, to sunken cities glowing beneath crystal lakes. Elven scholars spend centuries decoding prophecies written in stars, while dwarven forges ring with the crafting of weapons bound to chosen souls.

In the heart of it all, a quiet village may hold the child born under a rare celestial sign — the one whose choices could tip the balance between light and darkness. Destiny, however, is a wild thread. And in this world, even the smallest spark of wonder can ignite a saga. Fantasy
