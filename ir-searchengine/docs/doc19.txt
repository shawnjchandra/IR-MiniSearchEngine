Title: Keeper of the Moondust

In a land where stars fall as dust, a nomad collects remnants of the moon to weave dreams â€” until reality tears the sky apart. Each grain of celestial powder holds the memory of cosmic events spanning eons. The nomad's tent becomes a sanctuary where broken minds find peace through crafted dreams. But the gathering storm threatens to shatter the boundary between sleep and waking, between dreams and nightmares.
