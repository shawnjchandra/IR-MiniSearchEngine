Title: The Clockwork Citadel

In a realm of steampunk sorcery, the Clockwork Citadel stands as a relic of a forgotten war, its gears hiding a power too great to awaken. Brass pipes hiss with supernatural steam while mechanical familiars scurry through corridors lined with arcane machinery. The citadel's creator vanished centuries ago, leaving behind automated defenses that grow more sophisticated with each passing year. Deep within its core, a massive clockwork heart beats with the rhythm of lost souls.
