Title: The Sword of Storms

Forged in dragonfire, the Sword of Storms responds only to one with a heart pure enough to command it â€” and a storm is coming. Lightning dances along its ancient blade while thunder echoes in its steel. Legends speak of heroes who wielded it against impossible odds, but none have survived to tell their tales. The approaching tempest carries more than rain; it brings an army of shadow creatures that fear only the sword's electric wrath.
