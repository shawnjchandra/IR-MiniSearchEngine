Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence 
in machines that are programmed to think and learn. AI systems can perform tasks 
that typically require human cognition, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, 
or translating languages. There are two types: narrow AI, which is designed for 
specific tasks, and general AI, which aims to replicate full human intelligence. 
As AI technology evolves, it holds potential in fields like healthcare, finance, 
transportation, and education, but also raises ethical concerns about job displacement 
and data privacy.
