Title: AI in Agriculture

Smart farming tools powered by AI optimize irrigation, monitor crops, and predict yields, supporting sustainable agriculture practices. Drone technology equipped with computer vision identifies pest infestations and nutrient deficiencies across vast farmlands. Precision agriculture uses satellite imagery and soil sensors to create detailed field maps, enabling farmers to apply fertilizers and water exactly where needed. Weather prediction models help optimize planting and harvesting schedules.
