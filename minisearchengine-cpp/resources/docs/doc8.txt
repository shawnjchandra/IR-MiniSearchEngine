Title: AI-Powered Security

Facial recognition, behavior analysis, and predictive alerts are helping enhance public and private security using AI algorithms. Smart surveillance systems can distinguish between normal and suspicious activities in crowded spaces. Biometric authentication goes beyond fingerprints to include voice patterns and gait analysis. Cybersecurity systems use machine learning to detect anomalous network behavior and prevent data breaches before they occur, adapting continuously to new threat patterns.
