Title: Autonomous Vehicles

Self-driving technology is no longer science fiction. Through a combination of sensors, machine learning, and real-time data analysis, cars are learning to drive themselves safely. Advanced computer vision systems process thousands of images per second to identify pedestrians, traffic signs, and road conditions. Vehicle-to-vehicle communication networks share traffic information instantly, while predictive algorithms anticipate potential hazards before human drivers would notice them.
