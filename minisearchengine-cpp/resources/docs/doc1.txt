Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other 
organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. 
This process primarily occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, 
where the pigment chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. The energy from light 
drives the chemical reaction, resulting in the production of glucose and oxygen. 
Photosynthesis is not only vital for plant life but also for maintaining 
the Earth's oxygen levels, making it a fundamental biological process 
for nearly all living organisms.
